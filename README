Have you ever had to disable alerts, retry a check or acknowledge outages on a large amount of services with Nagios and hated the web UI for it?

This is a CLI tool and Ruby library that parses your status log file and let you query it for information or create external commands to be piped into the nagios command file.

See http://code.google.com/p/ruby-nagios/ for more information
